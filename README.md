## Monitor your BigPond usage on your Mac
This is a BigPond usage meter menu bar item for Mac OS X. It sits up in the top right near the clock. It monitors how much you have downloaded and uploaded (your usage) and the percent of the month or billing cycle.

It works on Leopard and Snow Leopard.

If you prefer, there is also a [dashboard widget](http://url3.tk/bp/widget.php) which does exactly the same thing, and has a nice graph too.

I am not affiliated with "BigPond" OR "Telstra Corporation Ltd" in any way.
